#fig = plt.figure(dpi=300)
            plt.plot(sp_marker[:,11]) # here you can see 1 if pulse has been triggered and 0 if  not. The gap at around 400000 (for this example dataset) is a short break inbetween the two IO curves and for each curve, you can nicely see 5 blocks (4x20 stim; 1x10 stim --> inbetween were a couple of seconds break)


# %% The timestamps of these two markers is identical
""" I would suggest to find the time of the jump from 0째 to 180째 in chan 12 and then cound the trig (=1) in chan 11. 
Then you know how many pulses of your data were applied at which phase.
As sometimes, the borders are not as clear as for this example set, see for example AmWo at post1, I would furthermore integrate a criterium to take the jump but only if phase has been 0 for at least 100000 ms beforehand (or something like that)"""

# might be useful:
test = np.where(sp_marker[:,11] == 1) # gives you the index of trigger points
triggercount = np.size(test) # amount of triggers; shoul dbe indentical with number of tms_artifact
#print(test)
#print(triggercount)
